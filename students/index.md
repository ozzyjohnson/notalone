## What should I do if I have been sexually assaulted?

### Immediately after an assault

#### Ask for help, tell someone:
* 911
*	Campus or local police, school resource officer, teacher or administrator
*	Friends or family
* Crisis hotline 800-656-HOPE (4673)

#### See a healthcare provider as soon as possible (e.g., urgent care or a hospital):
*	Receive help for physical injuries.
* Get screened for STDs/pregnancy.
* If possible, do not shower or clean up. Do not change clothes. Hospital staff can collect evidence using a rape kit.
* If you want to file a police report, you can call the police from the emergency room.
* Ask about the [nearest rape crisis center]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#find-a-service-near-you).

### Days following an assault
Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Remember that it was not your fault and you are not alone.

#### Learn about common reactions to trauma.
Everyone is different, but it is good to understand [what you might expect]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/preventing-sexual-violence-on-college-campuses-lessons-from-research-and-practice.pdf) and know that others have experienced similar reactions.

#### Let others help.
*	**Friends and family** can offer support by listening to you, keeping you company, walking to class or school with you, or going with you to appointments.
*	**Campus health centers, school nurses and counselors, and local clinics** can provide health services and help you find additional health resources including counseling.
    * If you are concerned about confidentiality: Ask the person you want to talk to first about his/her obligation to disclose information you share (e.g., are they required to file a report?). [See]({{ site.baseurl }}/students#will-what-i-share-remain-confidential) more information.
* **Local rape crisis center staff members** are experienced and can help you navigate the process. They can help you make choices about reporting an assault, joining a support group, or finding a counselor.
* [Learn more about your Title IX right]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/know-your-rights.pdf) to receive some immediate protection and help from your school, such as changing classes or dorms.

### Months after an assault

* Recovery is an **ongoing gradual process**. Understand [common reactions after trauma](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/problems/common-reactions-after-trauma.asp). Some symptoms may appear months after an assault.
* **Reach out** to your personal support network of friends and family. Find a support group.
* **Talk to a counselor, social worker, or psychologist.** They are experienced in helping individuals who have been sexually assaulted. They are familiar with the physiological and psychological effects that traumatic events cause. They can help you work through your emotions and teach you coping skills. [Learn more](http://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/help/index.html).
* If your school does not offer mental health services, [find a provider](http://samhsa.gov/tools/).

## How Can I Help a Friend?

* You can help someone who has been assaulted by listening and offering comfort.
* Go with your friend to the health center, hospital, administrator’s office or counseling.
* Reinforce the message that your friend is not at fault and that it is natural to feel a range of emotions, including sadness, fear, shame, or anger.
* Encourage your friend to promote physical well-being by eating, sleeping and exercising as well as possible.
* Keep an eye out for common reactions associated with traumatic events.
* Become an advocate. [Join or start an organization]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources).

## How Can I Help as a Bystander?

Tips for preventing sexual assault as a bystander:

1.	Talk to your friends honestly and openly about sexual assault.
2.	Don’t just be a bystander—if you see something, intervene in any way you can.
3.	Trust your gut. If something looks like it might be a bad situation, it probably is.
4.	Be direct. Ask someone who looks like they may need help if they’re okay.
5.	Get someone to help you if you see something—enlist a friend, residential advisor, teacher, or parent to help step in.
6.	Keep an eye on someone who has had too much to drink.
7.	If you see someone who is too intoxicated to consent, enlist their friends to help them leave safely.
8.	Recognize the potential danger of someone who talks about planning to target another person at a party.
9.	Be aware if someone is deliberately trying to intoxicate, isolate, or corner someone else.
10.	Create a distraction, draw attention to the situation, or separate the people you are concerned about.
11.	Understand that if someone does not or cannot consent to sex, it is rape.
12.	Never blame the victim.
13.	Go to itsonus.org and pledge to help keep everyone safe from sexual assault.

## Know Your Rights
<div class="section-context">
<div class="section-context-text">
### Your Title IX Rights
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs and activities receiving federal funding, including colleges and universities, and elementary and secondary schools.

All students – women, girls, men, and boys; straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming; students in elementary and secondary schools and colleges and universities; part-time and full-time students; students with and without disabilities; and students of different races and national origins – have the right to pursue an education free from sex discrimination, including sexual violence and harassment.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division enforce Title IX in our nation’s schools. Sex-based discrimination in public schools also implicates legal rights under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice.

</div>
</div>

<div class="section-context-text">
#### What are a school’s responsibilities under Title IX to address sexual violence?
- A school has a responsibility to respond promptly and effectively to reports of sexual violence.

- If a school knows (or reasonably should know) about possible sexual violence, it must quickly investigate to determine what occurred and then take appropriate steps to resolve the situation.
- A criminal investigation into allegations of sexual violence does not relieve a school of its duty under Title IX to resolve reports promptly and effectively.

- A school must ensure that the person who experienced the sexual violence is safe, even while an investigation is ongoing.

## How Do I File a Complaint About My School? And Then What Happens?
<div class="section-context">
### Can I File a Complaint?

<div class="section-context-text">
If you believe you are a victim of sex-based discrimination by, in, or under an educational program receiving funding from the federal government, you can file a Title IX complaint with both the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance include all public elementary and secondary schools (both traditional and charter) and postsecondary schools. Title IX also applies to most private colleges and universities because Title IX applies to any school that accepts students who pay, in part, with federal financial aid directly distributed to the students.  OCR also has jurisdiction over the few private elementary and secondary schools that are recipients of federal financial assistance.

If you file a complaint of sex-based discrimination with the DOJ, it can also be reviewed under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title IV), which provides similar protections to Title IX at all public schools.

[See more information about filing complaints with the Departments of Justice and Education.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/how-to-file-a-complaint.pdf)

<div class="section-context-text">
#### Is filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division the same as filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights?

No, though the process is quite similar. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has the authority to investigate all allegations of Title IX violations at educational institutions that receive federal funding. DOJ can investigate allegations of sex-based discrimination at educational institutions that receive DOJ funds (e.g., [a grant from the Office on Violence Against Women](http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/grant2013.htm)) under Title IX and at all public schools under Title IV. If you file with both DOJ and OCR, **usually, one agency will conduct the investigation of the school**. Occasionally, both agencies will conduct a joint investigation.

Both OCR and DOJ can and do conduct proactive compliance reviews under Title IX of schools the Departments fund, even in the absence of a complaint.

## Will What I Share With My School Remain Confidential?

<div class="section-context">
###Understanding Confidentiality
<div class="section-context-text">

Sexual assault survivors respond in different ways. Some are able to be public about what has happened to them. Some are ready to press forward with a formal complaint. Others aren’t so sure. And they need someone they can talk to confidentially -- to try to regain a sense of control, to start healing, and to sort through their options at their own pace.

If you are ready to talk to someone, you should decide whether to talk to someone who works for the school or someone in the community.  In making that decision, you should know that not all of a school’s employees can maintain your confidentiality in all circumstances.

In fact, some school employees – they’re sometimes called “responsible employees” – are required by federal law to share what they hear with others at the school so the school can investigate what happened and to take prompt action to address the situation. You should also be aware of any state or local mandatory reporting laws that may require certain employees (who may or may not be responsible employees) to share information you tell them with law enforcement or other authorities outside the school. Similarly, under federal law (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), parents are entitled to access most records created by a school employee about an elementary or secondary school student. In addition, if you end up in a lawsuit with your school, the school may be able to access any records made by its employees and use them in court if they are relevant. Your school should make clear to whom you can turn to talk confidentiality. If you’re not sure if someone can maintain your confidentiality now and in the future – ask before you talk to them.

To help make you more aware of your options, we offer [a sample policy](https://www.notalone.gov/assets/reporting-confidentiality-policy.pdf) on reporting and confidentiality for colleges and universities to consider. As with all policies, we urge schools to involve students and parents of elementary and secondary school students in coming up with the best solutions.  But all policies should make clear, up front, who at each school must share what information with whom – and how a school should weigh a survivor’s request for confidentiality against its own obligation to provide a safe environment for all students. This sample policy uses higher-education specific language but its general principles also apply at the elementary and secondary school level.


In general, rape crisis center advocates not associated with the school can speak with you confidentially. But because state law is always changing, be sure to check the accuracy of this information.

#### State Confidentiality Laws
While this list is a helpful tool, it is not a replacement for asking the person whether or not they are a confidential resource. Since state law is constantly changing on this issue, **be sure to verify the information** provided in this [guide to state laws covering confidentiality.](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/cdsv-related/Advocate_Confidentiality_Chart_2_2014.authcheckdam.pdf)

#### Federal Laws on Privacy Protections for Student Health Records

Student health records at most schools are protected by a federal law called FERPA.  For health care students receive outside of the school setting, in most cases, a federal law called HIPAA protects the information.
